Bootstrap Square UI
========================

##designmodo.com Square UI & Twitter Bootstrap 3.0
This is a mashup.
See Square UI at http://designmodo.com/square/
See basic Twitter Bootstrap docs at http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/
See Twitter Bootstrap 3.0 notes at https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342

If you're serious about using this, purchase Square UI from designmodo. It's prettier than whatever I could make in $150 worth of my time.

##Build
I swapped out Bootstrap's Makefile build process with a Gruntfile instead. The Gruntfile is shorter, more readable, and frankly, I have no idea how to use Make. Sorry.
See Grunt docs at http://gruntjs.com/

##Intentions
I got rid of Bootstrap's docs. They're not applicable to Bootstrap 3.0, and I hope to write a better example page anyway.
I don't intend to muck with the JS just yet.
